The head isn't foamy or creamy so much as it is a loose collection of brittle bubbles that would almost resemble blown insulation if it was pink. There's quite a bit of lace... that doesn't look so hot either.I'll bet that I could have identified this as an organic beer if blinded. Note that I didn't say an organic 'IPA'. There's a sour fruitiness emanating from the glass that doesn't smell the least bit hoppy. What it smells like is hard to say, but it doesn't smell appetizing.The flavor is no better (and might be worse since it lingers, unlike the aroma). What in the bloody hell is this supposed to be? An India pale ale? Hardly. Yeah, there's bitterness, but it could just as easily have been achieved by adding crushed aspirin to the brew kettles.Brewed-on or best-by dates don't usually appear in my reviews, but I'll make a exception in this case because, amazingly enough, the beer is relatively fresh (bottled on 8-17-07). It tastes like it's been aging in a rain barrel for the past several years.The flavor profile... whoa boy! Sour apricots, lemon juice, moldering grain, potter's clay and aspirin. The mouthfeel is horribly thin and is grossly undercarbonated to boot. Why didn't I go with the 'bottom of the barrel' score'? Because I can imagine worse.It's hard to be so critical of a brewer who is obviously trying to brew good beer. However, Santa Cruz India Pale Ale isn't good in any way, shape or form. And that's coming from a hophead who probably cuts beer of this style more slack than most. To the BA who sent me this bomber: don't forget, I know where you live.\",\n",
